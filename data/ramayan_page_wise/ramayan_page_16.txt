choice of words—“impelled,” “couldn’t help”—seems to have been greater than the one felt by a storyteller alighting upon good material. There is a mythic and religious dimension to Narayan’s later fiction, in which acts of personal devotion, self-effacement, and renunciation become a shield against the hard demands and uncertainties of the modern, impersonal world. This religious aspect of Narayan is explicit in his Ramayana . His admiration for Rama as a cultural and social ideal is clear  throughout the book. It leads him to preface his chapter on the controversial killing of the monkey king with these rueful words.   Rama was an ideal man, all his faculties in control in any circumstances, one possessed of an unwavering sense of justice and fair play. Yet he once acted, as it seemed, out of partiality, half-knowledge, and haste, and shot and destroyed, from hiding, a creature who had done him no harm, not even seen him. 3   Rama’s cruelty to Sita at the end of his battle with Ravana is one of the strangest episodes in  The Ramayana —one which directly challenges Rama’s image as an exemplary moral being. In fact, the Tamil poet Kamban, Narayan’s literary inspiration, makes Rama say some unsettlingly harsh things to Sita.
