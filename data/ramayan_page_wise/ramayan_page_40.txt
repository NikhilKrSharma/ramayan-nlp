fatigue, and even decrepitude. The King later asked politely, “Is there anything I can do?” Viswamithra looked steadily at the King and answered, “Yes. I am here to ask of you a favour. I wish to perform, before the next full moon, a yagna at Sidhasrama. Doubtless you know where it is?” “I have passed that sacred ground beyond the Ganges many times.” The sage interrupted. “But there are creatures hovering about waiting to disturb every holy undertaking there, who must be  overcome in the same manner as one has to conquer the fivefold evils 4  within before one can realize holiness. Those evil creatures are endowed with immeasurable powers of destruction. But it is our duty to pursue our aims undeterred. The yagna I propose to perform will strengthen the beneficial forces of this world, and please the gods above.” “It is my duty to protect your sublime effort. Tell me when, and I will be there.” The sage said, “No need to disturb your august self. Send your son Rama with me, and he will help me. He can.” “Rama!” cried the King, surprised, “When I am here to serve you.” Viswamithra’s temper was already stirring. “I know your greatness,” he said, cutting the King short. “But I want Rama to go with me. If you are not willing, you may say so.”
